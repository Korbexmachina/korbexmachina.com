Okay, building a website was both easier and harder than I thought. I ran into a lot of unexpected problems (particularly with relative paths) and I breezed through some things that I thought would be more difficult (including most of the CSS).

I built this site using SvelteKit, and it was a great overall experience. I learned a lot, and feel confident in my new front-end skills (after this project and [SlugBites](https://slugbites.azurewebsites.net/home/)). I'm excited to see where I can utilize these skills in the future!
